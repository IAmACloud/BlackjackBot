how do I bind this repository to my ros noetic-robot container

BlackjackBot repository to a ROS Noetic container. Here's how to do it:

1. First, make sure you have Docker installed and running on your Windows machine.

2. Create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` in your BlackjackBot repository root:

````yaml
version: '3'
services:
  ros_noetic:
    image: osrf/ros:noetic-desktop-full
    container_name: blackjack_bot
    environment:
      - DISPLAY=$DISPLAY
      - QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1
    volumes:
      - .:/root/catkin_ws/src/blackjack_bot
      - /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw
    network_mode: host
    command: bash -c "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash && cd /root/catkin_ws && catkin_make && source devel/setup.bash && bash"
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
````

3. Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:

````text
.git
.gitignore
*.pyc
__pycache__
````

4. Open PowerShell and navigate to your repository:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\naido\Documents\ChalmersCourses\TIF160_HumanoidRobotics\ProjectRepo\BlackjackBot
```

5. Start the container:

```powershell
docker-compose up -d
```

6. Connect to the container:

```powershell
docker exec -it blackjack_bot bash
```

7. Inside the container, create the necessary ROS package structure:

```bash
cd /root/catkin_ws/src/blackjack_bot
catkin_create_pkg blackjack_bot std_msgs rospy
```

8. Move your Python files into the correct ROS package structure and make sure to make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x /root/catkin_ws/src/blackjack_bot/scripts/*.py
```

9. Build your package:

```bash
cd /root/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Now your repository is properly bound to the ROS Noetic container and you can run your ROS nodes. Remember to:

- Place your Python scripts in the `scripts` directory of your ROS package
- Create a proper `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt` for your ROS package
- Use `rosrun` or `roslaunch` to execute your nodes

To stop the container when you're done:

```powershell
docker-compose down
```
